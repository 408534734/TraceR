Step to compile traceR (lots of dependencies makes this cumbersome).

1. Download and compile ROSS. Use the following commit
58a95d604d8cfad4e6a8e6fbe9960dfe76a03dc8
We are tied to this commit because ROSS and CODES seems to change API without
much of a notice.

Download command: git clone http://github.com/carothersc/ROSS.git
Compile commands:
cd ROSS; mkdir build; cd build;
ARCH=x86_64 CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ../
make ; make install

Choose ARCH based on your system.

2. Install codes-base. Follow the instructions in codes-base/README.txt.

3. Install codes-net. Follow the instructions in codes-net/README.txt.

4. Download and build Charm++ with bgampi target. Follow instructions here:
http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/charm++/A.html

Replace the "charm++" target with bgampi.

5. Set the appropriate paths in tracer/Makefile.common.

6. Change to tracer directory, and make.
