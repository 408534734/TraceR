To compile - make

To run - 
./genMapping <global_map_file> <ranks in each job>

Output - 
<global_map_file> in binary format
job{0,1..} files in binary format

Example:
./genMapping global.bin 32 32 64

generates global.bin with 128 ranks, where first 32 are mapped to job0, next 32
to job1, and last 64 to job2.
Also generates job0, job1, job2 that maps ranks from these jobs to global ranks.
